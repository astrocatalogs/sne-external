My paper on 2015bn has been accepted, so I’d like to put the data on the Catalog. I’ve uploaded the spectra to WISeREP so I guess those will appear soon enough. But I have loads of photometry too. I’ve attached my files here. Each text file is the light curve from a different instrument, but MJD and filters are clearly labelled in each. They should be easy to read, but let me know if there’s a better format to submit them in! Note that there is overlap in filters between the instrument files. Also please ignore any rows that begin with # — these are uncertain or unpublished!
